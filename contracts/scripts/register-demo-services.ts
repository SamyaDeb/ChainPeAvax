/**
 * Register 3 canonical demo services on the ChainPeRegistry.
 *
 * Registers Weather Oracle, Price Feed, and Summarizer AI — the services used
 * in the grant demo video and e2e tests. Safe to run on Fuji or mainnet.
 * Each service is idempotent: if the (developer, name) pair already exists the
 * script skips it rather than reverting.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   - DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY must own enough USDC to pay registrationFee × 3
 *   - DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY must be approved to spend `registrationFee` on the feeToken
 *     (the script approves automatically if needed)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx hardhat run scripts/register-demo-services.ts --network fuji
 *   npx hardhat run scripts/register-demo-services.ts --network avalanche
