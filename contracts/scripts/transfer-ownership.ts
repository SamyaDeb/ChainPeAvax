/**
 * Transfer ownership of deployed ChainPe contracts to a Gnosis Safe multisig.
 *
 * This script reads deployed contract addresses from the deployments/ folder
 * and calls transferOwnership (Ownable2Step) on each contract. The Safe must
 * then call acceptOwnership() to complete the two-step transfer.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SAFE_ADDRESS=0xYourSafe... npx hardhat run scripts/transfer-ownership.ts --network avalanche
 *
 * Env:
 *   SAFE_ADDRESS             (required) Gnosis Safe multisig address
 *   DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY     funded key that currently owns the contracts
 *
 * After running this script, import the contracts into the Gnosis Safe UI
 * and call acceptOwnership() on each to complete the handover.
