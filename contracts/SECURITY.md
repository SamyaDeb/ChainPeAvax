# ChainPe Contracts — Security Notes

Scope: the custom ChainPe contracts deployed to Avalanche C-Chain mainnet —
`ChainPeRegistryUpgradeable`, `PolicyVaultUpgradeable`, `ChainPeICMSender`,
`ChainPeICMReceiver`, `ChainPeTimelock`. (The `erc8004/*` registries are vendored
reference implementations of ERC-8004.)

## Static analysis (Slither)

Run per-contract (the whole-project run trips on the duplicate `ERC1967Proxy`
contract name — OZ's vs. the vendored ERC-8004 one — which is a tooling quirk,
not a code issue):

```bash
solc-select use 0.8.28
slither contracts/contracts/PolicyVaultUpgradeable.sol \
  --solc-remaps "@openzeppelin=node_modules/@openzeppelin" --exclude-dependencies
```

### Triage — all findings reviewed, none are exploitable

| Finding | Where | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `incorrect-exp`, `divide-before-multiply` | OZ `Math.sol` | Library code, false positive. Not ours. |
| `unused-return` on `functionDelegateCall` | OZ `ERC1967Utils` | Library code. Not ours. |
| `shadowing-local`: `owner` param shadows `Ownable.owner()` | PolicyVault `spend`/`previewSpend`/etc. | **Accepted.** The param name `owner` matches the EIP-712 `Spend(address owner,...)` schema and the event/getter names. The functions never call the `owner()` getter, so there is no behavioural shadowing. Severity: low/style. |
| `block-timestamp` used for comparisons | PolicyVault expiry/deadline/daily-cap | **Accepted & required.** All windows are multi-hour; validator timestamp drift (seconds) cannot meaningfully game them. |
| `missing-zero-address-validation` on `identityRegistry_` / `setIdentityRegistry` | ChainPeRegistry | **By design.** `identityRegistry == address(0)` is the documented "unset" state. |
| `reentrancy-events`: event emitted after external call | `ChainPeICMSender.sendPaymentIntent` | **Accepted.** `messageID` is returned by the messenger call, so the event must follow it. The sender holds no persistent funds (only a transient relayer fee it immediately approves to the trusted messenger); no state can be corrupted by reentry. |

The fund-custody contract (`PolicyVaultUpgradeable`) follows checks-effects-
interactions, uses `nonReentrant` on `deposit`/`spend`, EIP-712 + per-owner nonces
for replay protection, and keeps `withdraw` always available (not pausable) so a
pause cannot trap user funds.

## Trust assumptions

- **USDC is centrally administered.** It can blacklist addresses and is
  pausable/upgradeable by Circle. A blacklisted vault or recipient freezes the
  affected transfer at the token layer — outside this contract's control.
- **Relayers (PolicyVault `spend`)** are permissionless and not forced to submit
  promptly; a held authorization is recovered by re-signing with a fresh
  `deadline`.
- **Owner** controls UUPS upgrades. The deployer key currently owns the mainnet contracts and MUST be rotated to a `ChainPeTimelock` behind a multisig before significant TVL accumulates (see checklist).
- **ICM trusted senders** default to open until configured; the receiver only
  logs intents (no funds move) but should still be locked down.

## Post-deploy checklist (mainnet)

- [ ] **Professional audit** + bug bounty now that real-money TVL is live. These notes and
      the Slither pass are a first filter, not a substitute.
- [ ] Deploy `ChainPeTimelock` (24–48h delay), proposers = Gnosis Safe.
      `scripts/deploy-timelock.ts`.
- [ ] Deploy registry + vault with `OWNER_ADDRESS=<timelock>`. The deploy scripts
      now **refuse** a deployer-EOA owner on mainnet unless `ALLOW_DEPLOYER_OWNER=true`.
- [ ] If using ICM: configure trusted senders (`scripts/configure-icm.ts`) and
      attach a relayer fee (`sendPaymentIntent(..., feeToken, feeAmount)`).
- [ ] Full integration test (on a mainnet fork): deposit → setPolicy → relayed spend → withdraw → pause,
      plus a proxy-upgrade rehearsal through the timelock.
- [ ] Verify the implementation contracts on Snowtrace after deploy.
